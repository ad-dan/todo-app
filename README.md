# Todo app

This is a web app made by me that lets users add todo tasks.

## Info:

Users can enter the tasks that they want to
add. The app then saves those tasks in a
database, thus the information isn't lost.

## Languages and Frameworks:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* jQuery
